# ðŸŒ€ Back-Face Culling Examples â€” WebGL & OpenGL

## English

This repository contains practical examples demonstrating **back-face culling** using both **WebGL** and **OpenGL**. These implementations were developed as part of the **Computer Graphics** course in the **5th semester** of the **Computer Engineering** program at UNI.

The goal is to illustrate how hidden surfaces (faces not visible to the camera) can be efficiently discarded to optimize rendering in 3D graphics.

### Features
- âœ… WebGL example (HTML + JavaScript)
- âœ… OpenGL example (C++ with GLFW/GLEW)
- âœ… Clear and minimal scenes to show the culling effect
